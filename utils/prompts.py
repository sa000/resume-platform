Resume Filename:

IMPORTANT: Use the filename AND the resume text below to extract the candidate's name. Prioritize the filename as the source for the name unless the filename is unclear or generic (like "resume.pdf" or numbered files). If the filename is clear, use it. If the filename is unclear, rely on the resume text. Always format the final name in Title Case and remove all titles, designations, and nicknames.
